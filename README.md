### WhatsApp chat analysis
This script facilitates a comprehensive analysis of WhatsApp chats. It's designed to visualize the number of text messages, pictures, videos, etc. sent in total, and to identify which participant has sent the most messages. Just export your WhatsApp chat and run this R code.

*Important Note*: This script is specifically tailored for analyzing WhatsApp chats in **German**. If you plan to use it for chats in any other language, some modifications may be necessary:
- **Language-specific marker**: The code identifies specific text patterns, such as "Ende-zu-Ende-verschl√ºsselt" or "Bild weggelassen", which may differ in other languages.
- **Date and time formats**: This script assumes a specific format for date and time stamps, which can vary based on language and regional settings.
- **Regular expressions**: If the script uses regular expressions (Regex) to detect language-specific patterns, these will need to be adjusted for use in other languages.

So before applying this script to your exported WhatsApp chat, please check and adjust these aspects as necessary. Careful review and modification are crucial for accurate and meaningful analysis results.
